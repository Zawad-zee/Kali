Working as a Service Desk Specialist for 3 years, decided to take a leap into cyber security world before AI completely takes over the entry level tasks. Started off with few online resources and also took a course with my mentor Mashihoor Rahman from Australia ( https://www.linkedin.com/in/mashihoor/) , who not only provided the knowledge, but motivation and advices. 
Thinking about security, I have also added KALIGPT integration Debian package, when installing it, it will download the Ollama model on your local machine and you will be able to use it instead of uploading files in internet. 
With the hopes to land a job soon in the cyber security world!
