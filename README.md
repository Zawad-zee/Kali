# Kali
Working as a Service Desk Specialist for 3 years, decided to take a leap into cyber security world before AI completely takes over the entry level tasks. Started off with few online resources and also took a course with my mentor Mashihoor Rahman from Australia ( https://www.linkedin.com/in/mashihoor/) , who not only provided the knowledge, but motivation and advices. 
Thinking about security, I have also added KALIGPT integration Debian package, when installing it, it will download the Ollama model on your local machine and you will be able to use it instead of uploading files in internet. 
With the hopes to land a job soon in the cyber security world!

Recently worked on an offline Kaligpt project with the help of Chatgpt I have built it with several tweaks it took 2 weeks of my time as gpt are not accurate what they share. So had to do alot of back and forth prompting to polish it. I have uploaded the second version of the Kaligpt offline Debian package. I wish to work on it to make it more efficient and optimize it in future coming days. Please go through the read me file of the offline gpt for further instruction for installation and how to use it. Thank you
