This repository serves as a personal diary documenting my journey toward becoming a cybersecurity professional. My background includes a Service Desk Specialist role, where I developed crucial troubleshooting and IT support skills. 
While initially hesitant about IT-related challenges, this experience fostered my confidence and problem-solving abilities.

Driven by the increasing demand for cybersecurity expertise, particularly with the rise of AI, I'm transitioning my career to this field. 
This repository will track my progress, goals, and achievements as I acquire new skills and contribute to organizational security.

My initial steps involved guidance from mentors Mohammad Irshad (Canada) and Mashihoor Rahman (Australia). Mashihoor introduced me to Linux distributions, while Irshad's course led me to install Kali Linux as a base OS on a dedicated HP Elitebook. 
This involved overcoming challenges like a faulty USB drive firmware, and successfully installing Kali after adapting instructions originally from Mehdi Shakeel Youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GbmTkzoKlE .

**Challenges Faced:**

* **USB Drive Detection Issue:** My HP Elitebook initially failed to detect the bootable USB drive. Investigation revealed a faulty firmware issue on the non-branded 16GB USB drive, causing it to display an incorrect 32GB memory space. 
                                 This was resolved by acquiring and using a new USB 2.0 drive (as my laptop had USB 2.0 ports).
* **Installation Configuration:** While attempting to install Kali Linux, the initial instructions from Mehdi Shakeel did not work directly with my Elitebook's setup. 
                                  Through further internet research and assistance from GPT, I was able to identify and modify the necessary configuration settings (including partitions, BIOS settings, and ISO image mode) 
                                  during the bootable drive creation process to successfully complete the installation.
